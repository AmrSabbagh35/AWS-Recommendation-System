# AWS Cloud Services Recommendation Expert System

## Overview

Welcome to the AWS Cloud Services Recommender! This expert system is designed to assist users in selecting the most appropriate cloud computing services in Amazon Web Services (AWS) based on their specific needs, budget, and preferences. It offers various approaches and recommendations to simplify the process of utilizing cloud services and introduces users to the latest techniques in cloud computing.

## Project Development

### Gathering Information

In order to create an effective expert system, we embarked on a journey to gather precise data for this project. Our primary source of information was the official AWS documentation. However, given the complexity and vast array of AWS services, we sought guidance from cloud experts.

We were fortunate to connect with a cloud expert who helped review our work and select the most suitable AWS services to start with. This collaboration was invaluable, especially considering the scarcity of cloud expertise in our region.

To enhance our knowledge, we also participated in online courses on platforms like Coursera, which provided official paid Amazon courses. We also followed educational YouTube channels such as "Cloud Guru," "Network Chunk," and "Digital Cloud Training."

### Picked Categories and Services

The abundance of AWS services posed a challenge. With the guidance of experts and extensive research, we narrowed down our focus to the most essential AWS services across various categories, including:

**Computing**
- Amazon EC2

**Virtual Reality Development (VR)**
- Amazon Sumerian

**Web/Applications**
- Amplify
- Lambda
- Load Balancer
- Gateway
- Route53
- CloudFront

**Databases**
- RDS
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon Aurora

**Machine Learning**
- Lex
- Polly
- Rekognition
- Transcribe
- Personalize

**Blockchain**
- QLDB
- Amazon Managed Blockchain

**Security**
- IAM
- VPC
- Shield
- Macie
- Detective
- CloudWatch
- Guard Duty

**Game Development**
- Game Lift
- Lumberyard

**Migration**
- S3 Glacier
- EFS
- DataSync
- Server Migration Hub
- CloudEndure

### Questions Making

To offer personalized recommendations, we devised a set of questions that help us understand the user's preferences, budget, and specific needs. The questions vary based on the category of AWS services and user preferences. For example:

- What type of database do you prefer?
- What is your budget?
- Are you concerned about high security?
- What are your reasons for utilizing machine learning?

These questions help tailor our recommendations to meet the user's unique requirements. For instance, in the Web/Application category, choosing serverless computing might lead to a recommendation of AWS Lambda functions, which allows hosting code on the cloud and paying only for code runtime.

Budget-based questions enable us to provide cost-effective solutions, ensuring that our system caters to users with varying financial constraints. 

After a series of related questions, the system will formulate a conclusion and recommend the most suitable AWS services based on the user's responses.
